## *Short Project Description*
Identify several servers with software installed as golden images that users may provision for their projects. Work with stakeholders to identify the kind of servers they would need, and document the specifications for installing the software. Then procure the server and install the software. Work with the CCAC team to set up the golden images in the service Catalog so users can select a server out of the service catalog and provision it into their account.
